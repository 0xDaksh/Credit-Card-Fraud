In the world of Technology, Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions are fairly Common and this is a Deep Neural Network (Algorithm) that can classify these transactions just by looking at the data with 99.92% Accuracy which is likely to be very accurate.

This Neural Network is based of the [Credit-Card-Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud) Data available on Kaggle, It contains a whooping 248,407 Transactions which occurred in September 2013 by European Card Holders.
